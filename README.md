# Alex — Digital Marketer & Brand Strategist

This is a lightweight static site scaffold for a digital marketer and brand strategist.

Quick start

1. Preview locally: open `index.html` in your browser or use a static server.

   ```bash
   # from repo root
   npx http-server -c-1 .
   ```

2. Deploy: push this repo to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (publish from `main` or `gh-pages`).

Files

- `index.html` — single-page site
- `css/style.css` — styles
- `js/main.js` — form UX
- `assets/` — logo and placeholders

Want custom copy, branding, or additional pages? Tell me what tone, color palette, and case studies you want included and I’ll expand the site.
